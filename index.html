		Qualifications: B.Sc. B.Ed. M.Sc (Mathematics) TET Qualified <br/><br/>
		Through the years, I have been teaching Mathematics and Physics in the ICSE Board. I very well understand that each student has a different potential to grab knowledge from the classroom, and making each student understand the concepts and enjoy the classes is always my primary objective.<br/> 
		Keeping the covid-19 scenario in mind, online classes are the best that can be done to impart education. Once things start to get normal, offline classes can be considered.<br/>
		<br/>The interested students are most welcome to fill the form attached to the button below. Following classes will be conducted:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li> Class X Mathematics (CBSE) </li>
			<li> Class X Mathematics (ICSE) </li>
			<li> Class X Physics (ICSE) </li>
